Today (2nd of August 2021) I paid £2 for a 535g white loaf when it had been £1.50 since January. In response to this premium I am documenting the recipe for gluten free bread that I learned in 2020 when I impulse bought 6kg of gluten free flour at 33p/kg from Asda.

I have baked many wheat flour loaves while I was still enjoying gluten. The process is much, much different!

I want to illustrate why things are the way they are by including failed endeavours as learning experiences. Experiments were conducted from mid 2020 to 2021. The second generation recipe used xanthan gum and the proportions are pretty stable (and on the side of the xanthan gum container!). The first generation recipe is for informational purposes only and may be safely ignored..

## First generation - without gluten substitute

I bought flour and yeast. Making bread!

### Ingredients

- 325 ml water
- 1 teaspoon white vinegar
- 500 g gluten-free flour
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 2 tablespoons golden caster sugar
- A level teaspoon of dried, active, yeast
- 3 tablespoons oil

### Method

![starter culture](https://i.ibb.co/mX6pSbH/starter40ml.webp)

Warm the water to around 40-50ºC. Pour 30-50ml into a mug and mix in half the sugar and all the yeast. Transfer this starter culture to stand at the 40-50ºC for 10-30 minutes. If it hasn't frothed an inch within this time the yeast is probably bad. This is more than a test; the yeast will have multiplied to be ready for action.

#### Proving

Leave it somewhere warm, ideally 30-50ºC, with limited air flow, for a about an hour. After this time the mix should have doubled in size. Since we are not using gluten substitute there is really no need for a second proving. I had time to waste so tried.

#### Second proving (optional)

Knock it around the mixing bowl to obtain an even consistency again. Transfer to an oiled baking tin and repeat the previous proving procedure.

Bake for 30-60mins at 180-220ºC (longer and hotter if using psyllium or xanthan thickener). This loaf was baked an hour at 180ºC. I added a foil lid after 20 minutes and removed it from the tin for the final 10 minutes.

Recommendations to try here are:

1. Place a tray of water underneath to humidify and prevent cracks forming on top.
2. Cover around half way through to prevent losing too much humidity.
3. Remove from the baking tin for the last 10 or so minutes.

I observed the latter 2 recommendations.

Bread without a gluten substitute is really tough around the edges. Freshly baked, this is "crunchy" and pleasant. Popeye arms or power tools are required for cutting after day one. Asda have the flour at 33p a kg; cheaper than the rice it is (mostly) made from! I should have bought the self raising variety as that already contains (gluten) substitute.

## Second generation - with Xanthan

### Ingredients

- 490 ml water
- 500 g gluten-free flour
- 1 level teaspoon salt
- 1 heaped teaspoon sugar
- 1 level teaspoon of dried, active, yeast
- 2 level teaspoons of xanthan gum
- 2 tablespoons oil

### Method

Pour about 40ml of 40ºC water in to a mug and mix in the sugar and yeast. Stand at 40-50ºC for 10-30 minutes. If it doesn't develop a head of froth and smell of beer then the yeast is probably bad.

Mix everything well, adding the oil last. Excess water makes the dough adhesive. Xanthan gum also does this while also demanding much more water. Don't be afraid of it being too wet and sticking to everything. You want it wet enough to stick but not so wet as to self level. "Pour" it into an oiled baking tray and smooth with a wetted hand.

**Ideal consistency**

#### Prove and bake

Leave in a warm (~40ºC) place for about an hour. The rise depends on many factors, water, sugar, xanthan gum, and yeast. I actually covered it this time, in disposable foil. I was going to use this foil to trap moisture during baking.

An oven on low and/or a bowl of hot water below the baking tin are ideal heat sources.

After the hour of proving the dough had risen to the foil. After 10 minutes in the oven the two were inseparable. The rough surface was caused by it peeling away with the foil.

Bake at 180ºC for 50-55minutes. Removing from the tin for the last 10-20 minutes to expel all moisture. Contrary to what the initial stickiness would suggest, removal is helped by the loaf having shrunk 2-5% by whatever process. The bread had risen throughout and had no residual moisture.

Going forward I need it to not stick to the foil and so will be removing that at least before baking commences.
